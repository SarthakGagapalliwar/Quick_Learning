AWS EC2  => Elastic Cloud Compute
is a cloud sevice that provides resizable virtual service,called instances, while you can use to run applications

Imagine you're running a business and need a server
to host your website or application.

Instead of buying and managing physical servers,
AWS EC2 lets you rent virtual servers in the cloud.
These virtual servers are called instances.

• Instance Type: Select the hardware capacity (e.g., CPU, memory).
• AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Choose the operating system and
software (linux, mac, windows).
• Storage: Configure the type and size of storage (e.g., EBS volume).
• Security Groups: Set up firewall rules to control inbound/outbound
traffic.
• Key Pair: Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access.
• Network Settings: Configure VPC, subnet, and assign public or
private IP addresses.
• IAM Role: Attach an IAM role for permissions to access other AWS
resources.
• User Data: Add scripts to be executed when the instance starts.
• Elastic IP: Optionally associate a static IP address for consistent
public access.
