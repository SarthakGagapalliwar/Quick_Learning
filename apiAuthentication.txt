🔑 API Keys
API keys are like entry tickets 🎟️ — each client gets one and must show it with every request. They’re simple to use but don’t identify the user, only the app. Best for public or low-security APIs (like weather or maps).

👤 Basic Authentication
Basic Auth is the old-school way where you send your username and password (encoded) with every request. It’s easy but unsafe if not used over HTTPS. Best for testing or small internal tools.

🔒 OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is like getting a visitor pass 🪪 — you log in via Google/Facebook, and they give you a temporary token. It’s secure and widely used when you need delegated access, like social media integrations.

🪙 JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is like a signed movie ticket 🎬 — it contains your info, can’t be tampered with, and has an expiry time. Perfect for modern web/mobile apps where servers don’t want to store user sessions.

✍️ HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication)
HMAC is like putting a secret signature ✒️ on every request so the server knows it’s real and unchanged. It’s very secure and commonly used in banking, payment gateways, and enterprise APIs.

🍪 Session Cookies
Session cookies are like a stamp on your hand at a club 🎉 — once logged in, you don’t need to show credentials again, the cookie does it. Great for browser-based logins, but not the best for open APIs.


🌟 Quick Recap

API Keys → Quick, simple tracking.
Basic Auth → Old-school, test only.
OAuth2 → Delegated logins (Google, GitHub).
JWT → Stateless, modern apps.
HMAC → Super secure, server-to-server.
Cookies → Browser sessions.

Stateless Authentication (server doesn’t keep memory)
API Keys → Just a key checked each time, no server session.
Basic Auth → Username/password sent every request, nothing stored.
OAuth2 (access tokens) → Tokens are stateless, but the refresh token / authorization server part can be stateful.
JWT → Pure stateless (all info + expiry inside the token).
HMAC → Stateless, server only verifies signature, no memory needed.

Stateful Authentication (server remembers session)
Cookies (sessions) → Classic stateful method, server stores session data and links it to your cookie/session ID.


statefull Authentication = Stateful authentication means the server keeps memory (state) of logged-in users.
When you log in, the server creates a session (with your user ID, etc.) and gives you a token or session ID stored in a cookie.
Each time you send a request, the server looks up your session in its memory.
When you log out, the server deletes the session, so the token/session ID is no longer valid.

🌟 In short: The server remembers you (keeps state).

Why do we use sessions in software?
Without sessions: every time you click something, you’d have to log in again with username and password 😵.
With sessions: you log in once, server remembers you with a session ID, and you can keep browsing smoothly.

A session = server’s memory of “who you are” while you’re logged in. Without it, every request would feel like you’re a stranger.




🪙 Stateless Authentication

Stateless authentication means the server does not keep memory of logged-in users.
When you log in, the server gives you a signed token (like a JWT) that contains your user info and expiry.
Each time you send a request, you include this token, and the server verifies it without looking up any stored session.
When you log out, the token just expires (or is discarded by the client), since the server isn’t storing it.

🌟 In short: The server doesn’t remember you — instead, you carry your own proof (token) every time.

Why do we use stateless auth in software?
Without it: the server must store lots of sessions, which is hard to scale in big systems.
With it: the server only verifies the token, no need to remember anything. This makes it faster and more scalable 🚀.

🛠️ A token = your ID card
In stateless auth, you don’t rely on the server’s memory. Instead, you carry your own signed ID card (JWT) that proves who you are.
Every request shows this ID card, and the server checks its signature.
No ID card → you’re a stranger.




Example:

Stateless (JWT): Your movie ticket 🎬 has a printed expiry date. After that date, it’s invalid — no one needs to remember anything.
Stateful (Session): Your table at a restaurant ⏳ is reserved for 2 hours. After 2 hours, the waiter removes your table data.

✅ So both support expiry —
Stateless → expiry written inside the token itself.
Stateful → expiry stored on the server with the session.
