What is Apache Kafka?
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for 
building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
It’s designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency, fault-tolerant 
messaging between systems or applications.

Think of Kafka as a high-performance, durable, distributed “publish-subscribe messaging system” where producers publish 
events, and consumers subscribe to them.


🔹 Features of Kafka

✅ High Throughput – Can handle millions of events per second.
✅ Low Latency – Sub-10ms response times in typical setups.
✅ Scalable – Add more brokers/partitions to scale horizontally.
✅ Durability – Messages stored on disk & replicated across brokers.
✅ Fault Tolerant – Works even if servers crash.
✅ Stream Processing – With Kafka Streams, you can process data in real-time.
✅ Exactly-once semantics – Guarantees for message delivery (when configured properly).

🔹 Advantages of Kafka

Handles huge volumes of data (scale horizontally).
Durable storage – keeps events for a defined retention period.
Real-time streaming with exactly-once guarantees.
Flexible consumers – multiple services can consume the same events independently.
Integrates with Spark, Flink, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, etc.

🔹 Disadvantages of Kafka

Operational complexity – Setting up & maintaining Kafka clusters is not trivial.
Not optimized for small messages – Best for large-scale event streaming.
Learning curve – Steeper compared to simple message queues.
Ordering guarantee only per partition, not across the whole topic.
High resource usage – Needs good CPU, memory, and disk for performance.

Kafka is best when you need a scalable, fault-tolerant, real-time event 
streaming platform for large amounts of data. It’s the backbone of real-time 
analytics, event-driven architectures, and data pipelines in big companies like 
LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb.



Why not just use Databases?
A database is mainly designed for storing and retrieving structured data (tables, schema, SQL).
Databases store data on disk (secondary memory), which makes them durable — even if the server restarts, data is safe.
Databases are not built for high-speed ingestion of millions of events per second.

Why use Kafka then?
Kafka is not a database. It is a distributed event streaming system.
Kafka stores data in log files on disk (not RAM only), but it’s optimized with sequential writes and page caching, which makes it extremely fast — close to memory speed.
Kafka can handle unstructured or semi-structured data (no schema required).
Unlike a database, Kafka allows multiple consumers to read the same data stream independently.

Example: Zomato Delivery

When a delivery boy is moving, his location (latitude, longitude) is updated every second.
This produces a continuous stream of unstructured data.
Kafka can capture these real-time events and push them into different systems:
Location service → to track delivery live on the app.
Analytics database → to calculate average delivery times.
Notification system → to send alerts if a rider is late.
So Kafka acts as a real-time pipeline that streams events from producers (delivery app) to consumers (databases, dashboards, services).


Structured vs Unstructured in this case
Structured Data: Order details (start time, end time, customer ID, total price) → stored in a relational database.
Unstructured / Streaming Data: GPS coordinates of delivery boy (changes every second) → streamed into Kafka and processed in real-time.

Conclusion

Database = final storage, durable, queryable (historical records).
Kafka = real-time event stream, scalable, high-throughput (live data).
Both work together:
Kafka handles real-time ingestion.
Database handles long-term storage and queries.

In short:
Kafka = highway for fast-moving events 🚦
Database = warehouse for storing structured data 🏢
