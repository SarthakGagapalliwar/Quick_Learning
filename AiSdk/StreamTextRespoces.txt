AI models can sometimes respond slowly, especially when generating long answers.
If a user has to stare at a loading spinner for 5, 10, or even 20 seconds, it creates a poor user experience.

A better approach is to stream the response instead of waiting for the model to finish generating the entire text.

This is similar to the difference between:

Downloading a movie completely before watching it,
vs.

Streaming a movie on YouTube or Netflix.

With streaming, the user sees progress immediately, making the application feel much faster and more responsive.

✅ How We Implement This

To achieve streaming, we use:
Backend
Use StreamText() to get a streaming response from the AI model.
Then send it to the frontend using: =>result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();



Frontend (UI)
The UI uses the useCompletion() hook from the AI SDK:

const {
  input,
  handleInputChange,
  handleSubmit,
  completion,
  isLoading,
  error,
  setInput,
  stop,
} = useCompletion({ api: "/api/your-stream-endpoint" });


This hook automatically handles:
user input
form submission
receiving streamed text chunks
updating UI in real time
stopping generation if needed
The text appears incrementally, just like ChatGPT responses, giving users a smooth, fast, interactive experience.
