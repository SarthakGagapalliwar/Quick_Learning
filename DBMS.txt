🔑 1. Primary Key
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that 
no two rows have the same value and that the value is never NULL. 
For example, in a “Students” table, the student_id column could be the primary
key because every student has a unique ID.


🧩 2. Candidate Key
A candidate key is any column (or set of columns) that can uniquely identify a row in a table. 
Out of all candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key. 
For example, both email and student_id might be candidate keys for a “Students” table.


🗝️ 3. Alternate Key
An alternate key is a candidate key that was not selected as the primary key.
It can still uniquely identify records but is not used as the main identifier.
For instance, if student_id is the primary key, then email becomes the alternate key.


🤝 4. Foreign Key
A foreign key is a field that links one table to another. It references the primary key 
of another table to maintain referential integrity. For example, in an “Orders” table, 
customer_id might be a foreign key referencing the “Customers” table.


🧮 5. Composite Key
A composite key is formed by combining two or more columns to create a unique identifier 
when a single column cannot uniquely identify a record. For example, in a “Course_Enrollment” 
table, a combination of student_id and course_id can act as a composite key.


🚫 6. Super Key
A super key is any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table.
It may contain extra attributes beyond what is necessary for uniqueness. For example, 
{student_id, name} is a super key if student_id alone can uniquely identify the student.


✅ 7. Unique Key
A unique key also ensures that all values in a column are unique, but unlike the primary key,
it can accept one NULL value. For instance, in an “Employees” table, 
the email column can be a unique key.



📘 What is Normalization in DBMS?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce data redundancy 
(repeated data) and improve data integrity (accuracy and consistency).
It involves dividing large, complex tables into smaller, related tables and linking 
them using keys (like primary and foreign keys)

👉 In short:
Normalization = Breaking big messy tables into small, clean, and connected tables.


🎯 Why Do We Need Normalization?
🧹 Removes Redundancy
Avoids storing the same data multiple times (e.g., customer address repeated in many rows).
✅ Ensures Data Integrity
Keeps data accurate — when you update or delete something, it updates everywhere correctly.
⚡ Improves Efficiency
Reduces the amount of data to process, which makes queries faster.
🔗 Maintains Relationships
Creates clear links between related data using foreign keys.
🛡️ Prevents Anomalies
Avoids update, insert, and delete anomalies — common problems in unnormalized data.


🧱 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
A table is in 1NF if all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values, and each record is unique. 
This means there should be no repeating groups or arrays in a single column.
📘 Example: Instead of storing Subjects = "Math, Science", you should store them 
in separate rows for each subject.


🧩 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
A table is in 2NF if it is already in 1NF, and every non-key attribute is 
fully dependent on the entire primary key — not just part of it.
📘 Example: In a table with a composite key (Student_ID, Course_ID), 
the Course_Name should depend on Course_ID only — so it should be moved to a separate “Courses” table.


🔗 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
A table is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there are no transitive dependencies — meaning 
non-key attributes must depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes.
📘 Example: If Student_ID → Department_ID and Department_ID → Department_Name,
then Department_Name should be moved to a “Departments” table.

🧠 4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
BCNF is a stronger version of 3NF. A table is in BCNF if for every functional 
dependency (X → Y), X is a super key.
📘 Example: If a table allows a non-key column to determine another column,
 it violates BCNF — we must split it into two tables.

🧾 5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
A table is in 4NF if it is in BCNF and has no multi-valued dependencies.
This means one key should not determine two independent sets of values.
📘 Example: If a student can have multiple phone numbers and multiple hobbies, 
these should be stored in two separate tables.

🧮 6. Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
A table is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and cannot be decomposed further without losing data.
It removes join dependencies that are not implied by candidate keys.
📘 Example: It ensures data reconstruction from smaller tables without redundancy or loss.

🧮 6. Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
A table is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and cannot be decomposed further without losing data.
It removes join dependencies that are not implied by candidate keys.
📘 Example: It ensures data reconstruction from smaller tables without redundancy or loss.

🧰 6NF (Sixth Normal Form) (rarely used)
6NF deals with temporal data (time-based data). It breaks tables down so 
that each fact is stored separately and can change independently over time. 



⚙️ ACID Properties in DBMS
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
These properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably,
even in case of failures like power cuts or system crashes.

A transaction = a single logical unit of work (e.g., transferring money between two bank accounts).

💣 1. Atomicity → “All or Nothing”
Meaning
A transaction must be fully completed or not executed at all.
If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back — 
no partial updates occur.

📘 Example:
When transferring ₹500 from Account A to B:
Debit ₹500 from A ✅
Credit ₹500 to B ✅
If crediting fails, the debit is also canceled (rolled back).
Either both happen, or neither happens.

🧮 2. Consistency → “Valid State → Valid State”
Meaning:
A transaction must keep the database consistent before and after it runs.
All rules, constraints, and relationships remain valid.

📘 Example:
If total money in both accounts is ₹10,000 before transfer,
it must remain ₹10,000 after the transfer — not ₹9,500 or ₹10,500.
All constraints (like balance ≥ 0) must hold true.

🔒 3. Isolation → “Transactions Don’t Interfere”
Meaning:
Multiple transactions can run at the same time, but each behaves as if it’s running alone.
The operations of one transaction should not affect another until it’s complete.

📘 Example:
If two users are booking the same movie seat at the same time,
isolation ensures that only one booking succeeds, avoiding conflicts or double booking.

🧱 4. Durability → “Once Done, It Stays Done”
Meaning:
Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent — even if the system crashes right after.

📘 Example:
After a successful money transfer, even if the power goes off,
the updated balances are safely stored in the database and won’t be lost.

🧠 In short:
ACID ensures reliability in transactions — even when multiple users or failures occur.


⚙️ DELETE vs TRUNCATE in DBMS
Both commands are used to remove data from a table,
but they differ in how they work and what they affect.

🗑️ 1. DELETE Command
DELETE is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.
It removes specific rows (records) from a table using a WHERE condition.
You can control which rows to delete.
The table structure remains, and you can rollback the changes (if inside a transaction).

DELETE FROM students WHERE student_id = 5;

✅ Key Points:
Slower (deletes row by row).
Can use WHERE clause.
Can be rolled back.
Triggers fire (if defined).
Auto-increment value does not reset.

💣 2. TRUNCATE Command
TRUNCATE is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.
It removes all rows from a table — no WHERE condition allowed.
It’s much faster because it deallocates data pages instead of deleting row by row.
You cannot rollback once truncated (in most databases).
It resets the auto-increment counter.

TRUNCATE TABLE students;
📘 Example:
Deletes all records from the “students” table instantly,
but the table remains with its structure intact.

✅ Key Points:
Very fast.
Removes all rows at once.
Cannot use WHERE.
Usually cannot rollback.
Auto-increment value resets to 1.
No triggers fired.

💡 In short:
🔸 DELETE → Remove specific data, can rollback.
🔸 TRUNCATE → Remove all data quickly, cannot rollback.
