What is the Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM (Document Object Model).
Itâ€™s just a JavaScript object (tree structure) that mirrors the structure of the actual UI.

Frameworks like React, Vue, and others use it to improve performance when updating the UI.



ðŸ”¹ How it Works (Step by Step)

Initial Render
When your app loads, React (for example) creates a virtual DOM tree from your components.
This is then used to create the actual DOM elements in the browser.

State/Props Change
When data changes (like user input, API response, or state update), React doesnâ€™t update the real DOM immediately.
Instead,it creates a new Virtual DOM tree to represent what the UI should look like now.

Diffing Algorithm
React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the old one.
This process is called "reconciliation".
It figures out the minimal set of changes (differences or "diff") needed to update the real DOM.

Batch Update
React applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM.
For example:
If only one buttonâ€™s text changes, React wonâ€™t rebuild the entire page â€” it just updates that node.

Efficient Updates
Because manipulating the real DOM is slow, minimizing updates makes the UI faster and smoother.



<ul>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
</ul>

Now you add a new item C.
Without Virtual DOM â†’ Browser would re-render the whole <ul> element.
With Virtual DOM â†’ React compares old and new VDOM:
Old: <ul><li>A</li><li>B</li></ul>
New: <ul><li>A</li><li>B</li><li>C</li></ul>
Diff: Only a new <li>C</li> needs to be added.
React updates just that part of the real DOM.
