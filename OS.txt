⚙️ 1. Process Scheduling
Definition:
Process scheduling is the method used by the operating system to decide 
which process runs next on the CPU.
Because the CPU can run only one process at a time (per core), scheduling
ensures fairness, efficiency, and responsiveness.

Types of Schedulers:
Long-term scheduler – selects which processes are admitted to the ready queue.
Short-term scheduler – decides which process runs next (on the CPU).
Medium-term scheduler – handles suspended or swapped processes.

Common Scheduling Algorithms:
FCFS (First Come First Serve) – executes in order of arrival.
SJF (Shortest Job First) – runs the smallest process first.
Priority Scheduling – based on assigned priorities.
Round Robin (RR) – each process gets equal time in turns.
Multilevel Queue – different queues for different process types.



⚠️ 2. Deadlock Conditions (Coffman’s Conditions)
Definition:
A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are stuck forever, waiting for resources that the other holds.
Coffman’s Four Necessary Conditions (for deadlock to occur):

Mutual Exclusion – At least one resource cannot be shared (only one process can use it at a time).
Hold and Wait – A process holds one resource while waiting for another.
No Preemption – Resources cannot be forcibly taken away; they must be released voluntarily.
Circular Wait – A circular chain of processes exists where each holds one resource and waits for another.

💡 If any one of these four is prevented, deadlock cannot occur.

📘 Example:
Process A holds a printer and needs a scanner;
Process B holds a scanner and needs a printer → deadlock!


🚦 3. Semaphores
Definition:
A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to manage access to shared resources in concurrent (multi-process) systems.
It helps avoid race conditions where multiple processes try to modify shared data at once.
Types:
Binary Semaphore (Mutex): Has only two values (0 and 1); used for locking a resource.
Counting Semaphore: Allows multiple instances of a resource.
Operations:
wait (P operation): Decreases the semaphore value. If it’s < 0, the process waits.
signal (V operation): Increases the semaphore value and wakes up a waiting process.
📘 Example:
If two processes want to print on one printer, a semaphore ensures only one prints at a time.


🧠 4. Memory Allocation
Definition:
Memory allocation refers to how the OS assigns memory blocks to programs and processes.
It ensures efficient use of memory and prevents overlapping or wastage.
Types:
Contiguous Allocation – Each process gets one continuous block of memory.
Simple but can cause fragmentation (unused gaps).
Non-contiguous Allocation – Memory is divided into chunks that can be scattered.
More flexible and reduces fragmentation.

Methods:
Fixed Partitioning: Memory divided into fixed-size blocks.
Dynamic Partitioning: Blocks sized according to process needs.
Paging: Memory divided into fixed-size pages and frames.
Segmentation: Divides memory logically based on program structure (code, data, stack).
