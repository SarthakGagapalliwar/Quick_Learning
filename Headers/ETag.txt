ETag headers

The https Etage is responce header is an identity for a specific version of a resource.It let’s
caches be more effcient and save bandwidth, as a web server does not need to resend a full responce 
if the content has not changes.Additionally,ETags help to prevent simultaneous updates of a responce
from overwriting each other "mid-air collisons".


ETag Explanation

 W/"4fa-XB4KjhUWD9Q9FjdrxbogTOrf12411 => there are three part in this

1. W/ → Weak ETag prefix
The W/ means it's a weak ETag, which tells the browser or cache that the tag can be used 
for comparison but might not represent a byte-for-byte identical resource.
In contrast, S/ (if it existed) would indicate a strong ETag,
 meaning the content is exactly identical.

2. 4fa → Content length
4fa is a hexadecimal value representing the content length.
When converted to decimal, 4fa (hex) = 1274 (decimal) bytes.
This is useful because generating a full new ETag after every request can consume CPU power.
Instead, the server can first check the content length before computing the full hash, saving 
CPU time when the content hasn’t changed.

3.XB4KjhUWD9Q9FjdrxbogTOrf12411 → Hash value
This is a SHA-1 hash encoded in Base64 (27 characters).
It serves as a unique identifier for the specific content.
If the content changes, this hash also changes.


✅ Summary:
ETag is used for caching and efficient validation.
It helps browsers and servers quickly check if a resource has changed without 
re-downloading the entire file, improving performance and saving CPU resources.
