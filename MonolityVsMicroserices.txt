üß± Monolithic Architecture
In a monolithic architecture, the entire application ‚Äî 
Auth, Product, Order, Payment, Notification ‚Äî is built and deployed as one single unit (one codebase, one build, one deployment).

All modules share:
The same project
The same database
The same tech stack (e.g., Node.js or Java)
The same deployment pipeline

‚úÖ Advantages
Easier to start small projects
Simpler local development
Single deployment process
Easier inter-module communication (just function calls)

‚ö†Ô∏è Problems
1) Inefficient scaling=> If only the Product service needs scaling (e.g., high traffic on browsing)
, we still need to scale the entire application, wasting resources.
2) Code conflicts in large teams=> When many developers work on the same repo, 
merging and managing code becomes painful.
3)Expensive scaling => Scaling one feature means duplicating the entire app instance on multiple servers.
4)Difficult maintenance and onboarding => New developers must understand the entire codebase to add even a small feature.
5)Single tech stack limitation=> The entire app must use the same language (e.g., Node.js) even if 
another part would be better written in Go or Python.


üí° Example
If your e-commerce app suddenly gets a huge spike in traffic on Product pages,
you can‚Äôt scale only the product logic ‚Äî you must scale Auth, Orders, Payments, Notifications, etc., together.
That‚Äôs inefficient and costly.


‚öôÔ∏è Microservices Architecture
üîπ What it means
In a microservices architecture, each module (Auth, Product, Order, Payment, Notification) is a separate service ‚Äî a different project/repo, deployed independently.

Each service:
Has its own codebase
Can use any language (Node.js, Java, Go, Python, etc.)
Has its own database
Communicates with other services via APIs (usually REST or gRPC)

‚úÖ Advantages
1)Efficient Scaling
Scale only the required service.
Example: If product browsing increases, scale only the Product Service ‚Äî not Auth, Orders, or Payments.
2)Team Independence
Different teams can own different services (e.g., 4‚Äì5 developers per service).
This improves productivity and reduces merge conflicts.
3)Technology Flexibility
Each service can use the best language/framework for its needs.
Example: Product in Node.js, Payment in Go, and Notification in Python.
4)Cost Efficiency
You scale only the required services, saving infrastructure costs.
5)Easier Maintenance and Onboarding
Developers work only on one small service, making debugging and onboarding simpler.
6)Independent Deployment
Deploy one microservice (like Payment) without redeploying the whole system.


‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in Microservices
1)Complex Communication
Services communicate over the network via APIs ‚Äî e.g.,
The Order Service needs product details ‚Üí calls the Product Service API
The Payment Service verifies price ‚Üí calls Order or Product APIs
This introduces dependency management and network overhea
2)Latency and Reliability
API calls between services add network latency.
If one service (e.g., Product) fails, others (like Order) may also be affected.
3)Data Consistency
Each service has its own database, so maintaining consistency across databases is difficult (e.g., after an order is placed, updating stock in Product DB).
4)Monitoring & Debugging
Harder to trace a single user request across multiple services.
(Tools like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Grafana are used for distributed tracing.)
5)Deployment Complexity
Managing and deploying many small services requires DevOps tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, API Gateway).

| **Performance**     | Faster internal calls       | Slightly slower due to APIs         |
| **Complexity**      | Low (for small apps)        | Higher (needs coordination)         |


| Service                  | Tech    | Responsibility                     |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Auth Service**         | Node.js | Handle signup, login, JWT tokens   |
| **Product Service**      | Go      | Manage products, stock, pricing    |
| **Order Service**        | Java    | Place, track, and manage orders    |
| **Payment Service**      | Python  | Handle payment gateway integration |
| **Notification Service** | Node.js | Send email/SMS/push notifications  |

All services communicate using REST APIs or message queues (like Kafka or RabbitMQ).
