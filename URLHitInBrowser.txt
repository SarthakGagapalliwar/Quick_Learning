What Happens When You Type a URL in the Browser

1. URL is parsed
The browser breaks the URL into parts:
Protocol: https
Domain: google.com
Path: /search

2. Browser checks cache
Before making a network request, the browser checks:
Browser DNS cache
OS DNS cache
Router cache
ISP cache
If domain is found → skip DNS lookup.

3. DNS Lookup
If the IP is not cached, the browser asks DNS servers to resolve:

google.com → 142.250.183.14
Uses UDP (mostly) to contact DNS servers.


4. Browser establishes a connection (TCP Handshake)
Browser creates a TCP connection to the server:

Three-way handshake:
SYN
SYN-ACK
ACK

For HTTPS → next step happens.

5. TLS/SSL Handshake (for HTTPS)
To create a secure connection:
Browser and server exchange certificates
Key exchange happens
A secure encrypted channel is created
**Now communication is encrypted.....


6. Browser sends the HTTP request

GET /search HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com
User-Agent: Chrome
Accept: text/html
Browser also sends cookies, tokens, etc.


7. Server processes the request
Server does:
Routing
Database queries
Business logic
Generates HTML/JSON response


8. Server sends the HTTP response
Example response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 10240

Response body contains:
HTML
CSS
JS
Images
JSON (for APIs)



9. Browser receives and renders
Browser rendering steps:
a. HTML → DOM
b. CSS → CSSOM
c. DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree
d. Layout
e. Painting pixels on screen


Then:
JavaScript is executed
Additional resources are fetched (CSS, JS, images)


10. Page is displayed
Browser now shows the webpage to the user.


“When you type a URL, the browser parses it, 
checks cache, performs a DNS lookup, establishes a TCP and TLS handshake, 
sends an HTTP request, receives the response, constructs the DOM and CSSOM, 
runs JavaScript, renders the page, and displays it.”
