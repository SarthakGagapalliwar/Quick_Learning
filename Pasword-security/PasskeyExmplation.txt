🔑 1. Why Passkeys Are Needed

Traditional authentication on the web = username + password.
But passwords have big problems:
Easy to guess (weak ones like 123456).
Reused across sites (if one leaks → all accounts at risk).
Can be stolen by phishing or keyloggers.
User has to remember them.
👉 Passkeys solve these problems by replacing passwords with cryptographic keys.


🔒 2. What is a Passkey?
A passkey is basically:
A public-private key pair stored securely on your device (phone, laptop, security key).
Instead of typing a password, your device proves who you are by signing a challenge using the private key.
The server only stores the public key (not the private one).

This means:
Nothing to remember.
Nothing that can be phished.
If a server database leaks, attackers only get the public key (useless without the private key).

⚙️ 3. How Passkeys Work (Step by Step)
Let’s say you’re signing in to example.com with a passkey:
(A) Registration
You visit example.com → click “Create passkey”.
Your device generates:
Private key → stored securely (device/secure enclave).
Public key → sent to the server & stored in your account.
Now account = linked to public key, not password.

(B) Login
You visit example.com → click “Sign in with passkey”.
Server sends a challenge (random string, e.g., xyz789) to your device.
Your device signs it using your private key.
Sends back the signature.
Server verifies signature using your public key.
If valid → ✅ you’re authenticated.
👉 You never typed a password.
👉 Nothing secret leaves your device (private key stays safe).

📌 4. Example with Math (Simplified)
Let’s say:
Device generates key pair:
Private key = 12345
Public key = 67890

🔹 Registration:
Server stores 67890 (public key).
🔹 Login:
Server challenge: "HELLO".
Device signs it with private key → "SIGN(HELLO, 12345)" = "ABCD".
Device sends "ABCD" to server.
Server checks: Verify("HELLO", "ABCD", 67890) → ✅ valid.
Done. No password involved.

📊 5. Diagram: Password vs Passkey
PASSWORD LOGIN
───────────────
User → "username + password" → Server
        (password must be stored securely on server)

PASSKEY LOGIN
─────────────
1. User registers: Device creates (Private, Public)
   - Private key: stays on device
   - Public key: stored on server

2. Login:
   - Server sends Challenge → Device signs with Private Key → Server verifies with Public Key




🎯 6. Why Passkeys Are Better
No reuse → Each site has unique keys.
No phishing → Fake site can’t trick you into typing anything.
No leaks → Server only has useless public keys.
Convenient → Works with biometrics (FaceID, fingerprint).

👉 In short:
Passwords = shared secret (must be remembered + transmitted).
Passkeys = cryptographic proof (no secret ever leaves your device).




📊 3. Diagram: HTTPS + Passkeys Together
REGISTRATION (Over HTTPS)
─────────────────────────────
Client Device            Server
─────────────            ───────────────
Generate keypair         Store Public Key
(Private, Public)   ───▶ (linked to account)
(Private stays safe)

LOGIN (Over HTTPS)
─────────────────────────────
Client Device            Server
─────────────            ───────────────
Request Login     ───▶   Send Challenge
Sign Challenge           Verify Signature
with Private Key   ◀───  using Public Key
Send Signature


Why Both Are Needed
If only HTTPS:
Data is encrypted, but if you use a password, phishing or leaks are still possible.
If only Passkeys (no HTTPS):
Passkey challenge/response could be intercepted or modified in transit.
✅ Together:
HTTPS ensures secure transport.
Passkeys ensure secure authentication.


🎯 5. Real-World Analogy
HTTPS = like a secure, armored van 🚚 carrying valuables (your login messages).
Passkey = like a fingerprint lock 🔒 that ensures only you can open the vault.
Combined = safe transport + safe identity = end-to-end security.

So:
TLS = “nobody can read/modify what I send”.
Passkey = “prove it’s really me, without secrets leaking”.



🔑 Real-World Example: Google Passkey Login
Scenario
You want to log in to Google using a passkey on your phone/laptop.

(A) Registration Phase (first time)
1)You go to:
https://accounts.google.com/signup
✅ TLS (HTTPS) encrypts the connection.
2)Google asks to create a passkey.
Your phone/laptop generates a public/private key pair.
Example:
Private Key = stored in Secure Enclave / TPM / Keystore (never leaves device).
Public Key = sent to Google over HTTPS.
3)Google stores the public key with your account.
Now your account = YourEmail + PublicKey.
No password is needed anymore.

(B) Login Phase (next time you sign in)
1)You go to:
https://accounts.google.com/login
2)Google sends a challenge (random string) over HTTPS.
Example: "RANDOM123XYZ"
3)Your device signs the challenge using your private key.
SIGN("RANDOM123XYZ", PrivateKey) → SIGNATURE
4)Device sends signature back over HTTPS.
Message looks like:
{
  user: "sarthak@example.com",
  challenge: "RANDOM123XYZ",
  signature: "A9F81B..."
}
5)Google verifies the signature using your stored public key.
If valid → ✅ login successful.
If invalid → ❌ rejected.
6)Optional: If you’re on a new device, your phone can show a FaceID/fingerprint prompt.
This unlocks the private key to sign the challenge.

📊 Flow Diagram
LOGIN WITH PASSKEY (Google)
─────────────────────────────────────────
You (Device)                 Google Server
───────────                  ─────────────
1. Visit login page   ───▶   Over HTTPS

2. Server sends challenge ◀── "RANDOM123XYZ"

3. Device signs with
   Private Key         ───▶   Signature sent

4. Server checks signature
   using stored Public Key

5. If match → ✅ Logged in


🛡️ Why This is Secure
Private key never leaves your device.
Challenge is random → prevents replay attacks.
Everything travels inside HTTPS → encrypted in transit.
No password typed → phishing-resistant.

🌍 Real Implementations
Google Account → Passkeys instead of passwords.
Apple iCloud Keychain → Stores and syncs your passkeys across devices.
Windows Hello → Uses face/fingerprint for passkeys.
FIDO2/WebAuthn Standard → Universal protocol behind passkeys.

✅ In summary:
Passkeys = cryptographic login (proves identity).
HTTPS = secure tunnel (protects messages in transit).
Together = safe, phishing-proof login system.
