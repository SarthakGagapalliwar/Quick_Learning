 1. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**

* Purpose:** Secure communication over the internet, primarily for websites. Ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication.
* How it works:**
  * Uses HTTP** for communication but encrypts the data with TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.
  * TLS encrypts the data between client and server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
  * HTTPS uses certificates** issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to verify the server's identity.

* Benefits:**
  * Data encryption protects sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers).
  * Confirms the website’s authenticity to prevent phishing attacks.

* Limitations:**
  * Requires a valid TLS certificate (can be costly for organizations).
  * Slightly slower than HTTP due to encryption overhead, but negligible with modern hardware.

**Example:** Browsing a bank website uses `https://` to secure transactions.

 2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**

* Purpose:** Provides fast, connectionless communication** for applications that prioritize speed over reliability.

* How it works:**
  * Sends packets (datagrams) directly without establishing a connection.
  * No acknowledgments or error checking at the protocol level.

* Benefits:**
  * Low latency and minimal overhead. Ideal for real-time apps.

* Limitations:**
  * Packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.
  * Reliability must be handled by the application if needed.

**Example:** Online gaming, video conferencing, live streaming.

 3. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**

* Purpose:** Provides reliable, ordered communication** over the internet.

* How it works:**
  * Establishes a connection** between client and server using a three-way handshake**.
  * Each packet is acknowledged; lost packets are retransmitted.
  * Maintains the correct order of packets.

* Benefits:**
  * Reliable delivery of data, ensuring complete and ordered transfer.
  * Detects errors and manages flow control.

* Limitations:**
  * Higher latency due to acknowledgments and retransmissions.
  * More overhead than UDP, which may affect performance in real-time apps.

**Example:** Downloading files, sending emails, web browsing (`HTTP/HTTPS` runs over TCP).

---

 4. Internet Protocol (IP)**

* Purpose:** Routes and delivers packets across networks from the source to the destination.

* How it works:**
  * Adds source and destination IP addresses** to each packet.
  * Works with routers to forward packets through multiple networks.

* Benefits:**
  * Forms the fundamental layer of internet communication.
  * Enables devices globally to communicate.

* Limitations:**
  * IP itself does not guarantee delivery, reliability, or order.
  * Works best with TCP to ensure reliability.

**Example:** Your laptop sends a request to `example.com`; IP ensures packets reach the server.

 5. Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**

* Purpose:** Securely transfers files between systems over a network.

* How it works:**
  * Runs over SSH**, encrypting both authentication and data transfer.
  * Unlike FTP, it does not send data in plaintext.

* Benefits:**
  * Secure against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks.
  * Can manage permissions and perform file operations remotely.

* Limitations:**
  * Requires an SSH server; incompatible with plain FTP clients.
  * Slightly slower than FTP due to encryption overhead.

**Example:** Uploading files to a web server securely.

---

 6. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**

* Purpose:** Sends emails from a client to a mail server** or between mail servers**.

* How it works:**
  * Uses commands like `HELO`, `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, and `DATA` to deliver messages.
  * Works typically with ports 25, 465 (SMTPS), or 587**.

* Benefits:**
  * Reliable for sending emails across the internet.

* Limitations:**
  * Cannot retrieve or read emails from a mailbox. Requires IMAP** or POP3** for access.
  * Needs authentication to prevent misuse (spam).

**Example:** Gmail sending an email to Outlook uses SMTP servers to relay the message.

---

 7. Secure Shell (SSH)**

* Purpose:** Provides secure remote access to servers for administration and file transfer.

* How it works:**
  * Creates an encrypted channel** using keys (public/private) or passwords.
  * Uses encryption (like AES) to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

* Benefits:**
  * Secures remote command execution and file transfers.
  * Supports tunneling other protocols securely.

* Limitations:**
  * Requires proper key management; compromised keys can allow unauthorized access.
  * Misconfiguration may lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Admin logs into a Linux server remotely using `ssh user@server.com`.

---

 8. Domain Name System (DNS)**

* Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) to IP addresses for devices to locate servers.

* How it works:**
  * Client queries DNS servers** recursively or iteratively.
  * DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.

* Benefits:**
  * Makes the internet user-friendly; we don’t need to remember numeric IPs.
  * Supports load balancing and redundancy through multiple DNS servers.

* Limitations:**
  * Adds latency during the first lookup (usually cached afterward).
  * Vulnerable to attacks like DNS spoofing or cache poisoning.

**Example:** Typing `www.google.com` in a browser queries a DNS server to find `142.250.190.78`.
