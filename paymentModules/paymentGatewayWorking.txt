When you make a payment, the process goes like this:

Payment Gateway Role=>
The user enters card details such as card number, CVV, and expiry date.
The payment gateway securely sends this information to the bank.
It also performs address verification to match the billing address and prevent fraud.

Security Measures=>
Encryption: Protects payment data during transmission (from device → gateway → merchant). The data is encrypted so it becomes unreadable without a decryption key.
Tokenization: Protects data at rest (when stored). Instead of storing the actual card number, a randomly generated token is stored. This token is used for future transactions instead of the real card number.

✅ Key difference:
Encryption = original data is encrypted and decrypted when needed.
Tokenization = original data is never stored; only tokens are kept.

Payment Gateway vs Processor
The payment gateway does not check the funds on the card.
It simply acts as a bridge, forwarding the encrypted payment information to the payment processor.

Payment Processor Role
The processor communicates with the issuing bank (the customer’s bank).
The bank checks if there are sufficient funds and whether the transaction is valid.
If approved, the processor authorizes the transaction and moves the money.
If declined, the processor informs the payment gateway, which then notifies the merchant.

Working with Visa/Mastercard

When transactions involve networks like Visa or Mastercard, both the payment gateway and the payment processor work together.
The networks ensure that:
The transaction is authorized.
Funds move correctly from the customer’s account to the merchant’s account
