✅ What is an SSH Connection?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to a 
remote computer or server over a network.

An SSH connection means you are connecting to another machine securely using encryption.

🔐 What does SSH do?
When you use SSH:
Your password is encrypted
Your commands are encrypted
Your data is encrypted
Hackers cannot read what you send
It is the safest way to administer remote servers.


🧠 Why do we use SSH?
✔ To access remote servers
✔ To run commands on a remote machine
✔ To upload/download files securely
✔ To manage cloud servers (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)

SSH connection is a secure, encrypted way to access and control a 
remote computer over a network. It lets you login to servers, run commands, 
transfer files, and manage systems safely.


✅ What is SSH Tunneling?
SSH tunneling (also called SSH port forwarding) is a technique where you use an SSH connection 
to securely send data from one computer to another by tunneling traffic through an 
encrypted SSH channel.

👉 SSH tunneling creates a secure, encrypted path for your data through SSH.

It allows you to safely access services that are:
Behind a firewall
On a private network
Not exposed to the internet

🧠 Why do we use SSH tunneling?
✔ 1. To access a remote resource securely
Example: Access a database hosted only on a private network.

✔ 2. To bypass network restrictions
Like opening a blocked website by routing traffic through a secure server.

✔ 3. To protect sensitive data
All communication inside the tunnel is end-to-end encrypted.

✔ 4. To securely connect to internal servers from outside
You can reach internal APIs, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.

🎯 Short Interview Answer

SSH tunneling is a way to securely forward network traffic through an 
encrypted SSH connection. It is used to access remote services safely, 
bypass restrictions, and protect sensitive data using port forwarding (local, remote, or dynamic).
