IAM => Identtity and Access Management -> it's both

Who gets in? What they can do..


🧠 IAM — Identity and Access Management
A system that helps organisations manage who can access what.

In short:
Identity = Who gets in
Access Management = What they can do

| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity**          | **AuthN (Authentication)** | Verifies *who you are* — login, user provisioning, credentials |
| **Access Management** | **AuthZ (Authorization)**  | Controls *what you can do* — roles, policies, permissions      |



System that helps orginations mange Who can access What
⚙️ How It Works (Example)

When you log in to GitHub using Google:
You click “Sign in with Google.”
GitHub redirects you to Google (your IdP).
You log in to Google (enter password, maybe 2FA).
Google verifies your credentials (✅ AuthN).
Google sends a secure token (SAML or OpenID Connect) back to GitHub.
GitHub trusts Google’s token and logs you in.

👉 You never share your Google password with GitHub —
GitHub trusts Google to handle your identity safely.


🪪 Identity Provider (IdP)
The IdP handles authentication — the “Who are you?” part.

What IdP does:
Verifies your credentials (password, MFA, etc.)
Issues a secure token (like SAML or OpenID Connect) if valid
Sends that token to the service provider (SP)
Example IdPs: Google, Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity, Auth0

🧾 Service Provider (SP)

The SP (like GitHub, AWS, Salesforce) accepts that token from the IdP.
If valid, it lets you in — no extra password needed.

Once you’re inside, Authorization (AuthZ) takes over.


🧱 Authorization (AuthZ) — “What you can do”
After login, IAM defines your boundaries — what actions or data you’re allowed to access.

Example:

In a hospital system, a nurse can view patient data
An admin can add or delete users
A developer can only modify backend systems
IAM uses roles, groups, and attributes to enforce these rules.



⚖️ Authorization Models

| Type                                      | Meaning                                                           | Example                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**      | Access based on job role                                          | Admins can delete users; Viewers can only read                         |
| **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** | Access based on attributes (department, time, location, etc.)     | Allow access only if `department = "Cardiology"`                       |
| **PBAC / Policy-Based Access Control**    | Rules defined as policies (evaluated by decision engine like OPA) | “Allow access to `/records` only if user.role = doctor and time < 6PM” |


🧭 Real-World Analogy
Think of IAM like a security system for an organisation:
| Step                 | Who handles it                 | What it means           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Check ID**         | 🪪 *Identity Provider (AuthN)* | Verifies who you are    |
| **Check Permission** | 🧾 *Access Management (AuthZ)* | Decides what you can do |
