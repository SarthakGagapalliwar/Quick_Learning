 SSL(Secure Sockets Layer)

What is an SSL Certificate and do we need it? - An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that provides security for online communication by encrypting data transmitted between a website and a user's browser


WHy we use ssl certoficat=-> explation by clint and server


clint ----->GET----> server
      <-----Res<----

in this server have have tere own public key and private key

server goes to Auth who ake the the server ex-> we take LetsEncrypt;

lets Encrypt => take the public key from the server and domain name form the server and make the certificat have the Sign of letsEncy=>public server + public key Auth(letsEncrypt);

    SSL certificat
  ----------------- 
  | pub key server|
  |         |
  |---------|
  | Sign    |    Sign=>public server + public key Auth(letsEncrypt);
  |         |
  |---------|  

  public key of certificat
  private key of certificat


this certificat have send to server then this certificat have given to clint and clint have the public key of server and certificat , the key have send by the server will first verify that this is OG public that have send by the server 
to check this clint will try to open the certificat need the public key of letsEncrypt 
it will take the public key from it and to check the public that have share by the server 
is correct or not Now it will open(verify) by public key of letsEncrypt ans public key of server
if certificat open then the public key of server is correct; 



then clint make the own public key => and decrypt by the public that have share by the server 
then this public(clint) will shre to server which can decrypt by server private key only 




SAME WE HAVE TLS also =>Used in all modern secure connections
