✅ What is WebRTC?
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that allows real-time communication
(audio, video, and data) directly between browsers or devices without needing a server 
in the middle after the connection is established.

It enables:
Live video calls
Voice calls
Real-time messaging
Peer-to-peer file sharing
All directly between users using their browsers.

🧩 How WebRTC works (Very simple)
WebRTC connects two devices directly using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication.

Steps:
Both browsers exchange connection information using a signalling server
A direct P2P connection is created
Audio/Video/Data flows directly between devices


WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time audio, video, and data communication directly between 
browsers using peer-to-peer connections. It is used in video calling apps, 
voice calls, screen sharing, real-time messaging, and P2P file sharing.


🔥 WebRTC vs WebSockets — Explained Clearly

| Feature                   | **WebRTC**                                                 | **WebSockets**                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Type**                  | Peer-to-peer communication                                 | Client ↔ Server communication      |
| **Use Case**              | Real-time audio, video, P2P data                           | Real-time text/data                |
| **Latency**               | Ultra-low latency                                          | Low latency                        |
| **Server Involvement**    | Needed only for signaling                                  | Needed for entire communication    |
| **Supports Audio/Video?** | ✔ Yes                                                      | ❌ No                               |
| **Best For**              | Video calls, voice calls, screen sharing, P2P file sharing | Chats, notifications, live updates |
| **Protocol**              | Uses UDP (mostly) + SRTP                                   | Uses TCP                           |
| **Security**              | DTLS / SRTP                                                | WSS (TLS)                          |
| **Data Transfer**         | High-volume, fast P2P                                      | Continuous reliable messages       |


WebSockets provide full-duplex communication between client and server, ideal for chats 
and live updates. WebRTC provides peer-to-peer communication designed for real-time 
audio, video, and fast data transfer. WebSockets rely on TCP while WebRTC uses
UDP-based protocols for low latency.
