🌐 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
🔹 Definition:
The OSI model is a conceptual framework that describes how data moves across a network 
— from one computer to another.
It divides the communication process into 7 layers, where each layer has its own specific functions.

🧱 The 7 Layers of the OSI Model
1️⃣ Physical Layer
Function:
Deals with the actual transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium such as cables, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics.
It defines hardware devices, cables, voltages, and data rates.
📘 Example: Ethernet cables, network cards, hubs, repeaters.
💡 It sends electrical signals — not meaningful data

2️⃣ Data Link Layer
Function:
Responsible for node-to-node delivery and error detection/correction.
It ensures reliable transmission of data across the physical network link using frames.
📘 Example: MAC addresses, switches, and protocols like Ethernet & PPP.
💡 Divides data into frames and handles collisions.

3️⃣ Network Layer
Function:
Handles routing and forwarding of data between devices on different networks.
It uses logical addressing (IP addresses) to determine the best path for data.
📘 Example: Routers, IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP.
💡 Delivers packets from source to destination across multiple networks.

4️⃣ Transport Layer
Function:
Ensures end-to-end communication between devices, managing segmentation, error recovery, and flow control.
It guarantees reliable or unreliable delivery depending on the protocol used.
📘 Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster, no guarantee).
💡 Breaks data into segments and ensures they arrive in order.

5️⃣ Session Layer
Function:
Manages and controls sessions (connections) between two devices.
It handles session creation, maintenance, and termination.
📘 Example: Login sessions, video calls, or remote desktop connections.
💡 Maintains communication state between sender and receiver.

6️⃣ Presentation Layer
Function:
Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.
It ensures the data sent by the sender is readable by the receiver, even if they use different formats.
📘 Example: SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG, MPEG, ASCII, EBCDIC.
💡 It acts as a “translator” — formats and secures data.

7️⃣ Application Layer
Function:
This is the topmost layer — where users interact with the network through applications.
It provides network services like email, web browsing, file transfer, and chatting.
📘 Example: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, POP3.
💡 Directly interacts with the user or software application.

| Layer No. | Layer Name   | Data Unit | Function                                  | Devices/Protocols  |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **7**     | Application  | Data      | User interface & services                 | HTTP, FTP, SMTP    |
| **6**     | Presentation | Data      | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL, TLS, JPEG     |
| **5**     | Session      | Data      | Manage sessions between apps              | NetBIOS, RPC       |
| **4**     | Transport    | Segments  | Reliable delivery, flow control           | TCP, UDP           |
| **3**     | Network      | Packets   | Routing & addressing                      | Routers, IP, ICMP  |
| **2**     | Data Link    | Frames    | Node-to-node delivery, error detection    | Switches, Ethernet |
| **1**     | Physical     | Bits      | Transmission of raw bits                  | Cables, Hubs, NIC  |

💡 In short:
The OSI model helps standardize how computers communicate,
ensuring different devices and software can talk to each other smoothly.
